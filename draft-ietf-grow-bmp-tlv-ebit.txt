  Support for Enterprise-specific TLVs in the BGP Monitoring Protocol
                    draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit-03

Abstract

   Message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) do
   provision for data in TLV - Type, Length, Value - format, either in
   the shape of a TLV message body, ie.  Route Mirroring and Stats
   Reports, or optional TLVs at the end of a BMP message, ie.  Peer Up
   and Peer Down.  However the space for Type value is unique and
   governed by IANA.  To allow the usage of vendor-specific TLVs, a
   mechanism to define per-vendor Type values is required.  In this
   document we introduce an Enterprise Bit, or E-bit, for such purpose.

1.  Introduction

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) is defined in RFC 7854 [RFC7854].
   Support for TLV data is extended by TLV support for BMP Route
   Monitoring and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv].

   Vendors need the ability to define proprietary Information Elements
   for various reasons such as delivering a pre-standard product.  This
   aligns with Section 4.1 of [RFC8126].

   Also for code point assignment to be eligible, an IETF document needs
   to be adopted at a Working Group and in a stable condition.  In this
   context E-bit helps during early development phases where inter-
   operability among vendors is tested and shipped to network operators
   for testing.  This aligns with Section 4.2 of [RFC8126].

   This document re-defines the format of IANA-registered TLVs in a
   backward compatible manner with respect to previous documents and
   existing IANA allocations; it also defines the format for newly
   introduced enterprise-specific TLVs.

   The concept of an E-bit, or Enterprise Bit, is not new.  For example,
   such mechanism is defined in Section 3.2 of [RFC7011] for a very
   similar purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  TLV encoding

3.1.  IANA-registered TLV encoding

   Existing TLV encodings are defined in Section 4.4 of [RFC7854]
   (Information TLVs), Section 4.7 of [RFC7854] (Route Mirroring TLVs),
   Section 4.8 of [RFC7854] (Stats Reports TLVs),
   draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and
   draft-ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up] and are
   updated as follows:

   *  1 bit to flag an enterprise-specific TLV, set to zero.  The TLV
      Type value must have been defined in IANA-BMP [IANA-BMP]

   *  15 bits of TLV Type,

   *  2 octets of TLV Value length,

   *  0 or more octets of TLV Value.


      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

3.2.  Enterprise-specific TLV encoding

   Enterprise-specific TLV encoding is defined as follows:

   *  1 bit to flag an enterprise-specific TLV, set to one

   *  15 bits of TLV Type,

   *  2 octets of TLV length.  Comprising length of IANA PEN plus TLV
      value,

   *  4 octets of IANA Private Enterprise Number IANA-PEN [IANA-PEN]

   *  0 or more octets of TLV Value.

   In case of indexed TLVs, as defined by TLV support for BMP Route
   Monitoring and Peer Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv], the index
   value follows the Enterprise number.

3.3.  TLV encoding remarks

   The TLV encoding specified in this document applies to all existing
   BMP Message Types and their namespaces defined in RFC 7854 [RFC7854],
   TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer Down Messages
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] and BMP Peer Up Message Namespace
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up].

   While the proposed encoding is not per-se backward compatible, there
   is no existing IANA-allocated Type value that makes use of the most
   significant bit (which is being used in this document to define the
   E-bit), except the experimental and reserved ones mentioned in
   Section 10.5 of [RFC7854], Section 10.6 of [RFC7854] and Section 10.9
   of [RFC7854].  These are all still honored and excluded by the E-bit
   mechanism such that no PEN will be included as part of the TLV.

   Future BMP Message Types MUST make use of the TLV encoding defined in
   this document.

   This document refers to TLV support for BMP Route Monitoring and Peer
   Down Messages [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv] for any recommendations
   regarding the use of TLVs (ie. repetitions, ordering, etc.).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add any additional security considerations.

5.  Operational Considerations

   It is recommended that vendors making use of the Enterprise Bit
   extension have a well-defined internal registry for privately
   assigned code points that is also exposed to the public.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The TLV Type values used by BMP are managed by IANA as are the
   Private Enterprise Numbers used by enterprise-specific Type values
   IANA-PEN [IANA-PEN].  This document makes no changes to these
   registries.
